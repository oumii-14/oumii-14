 👋 Hi, I’m @oumii-14

I'm a beginner programmer who's passionate about learning new technologies and building cool, useful things with code! 🚀
 👀 I’m interested in:
- Programming with **Visual Basic**, **C**,**SQL** and FrontEnd (HTML,CSS,JS)
- Building small apps, automation tools, and working with databases
- Learning how software works from the inside out

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- **FrontEnd** to create creative and interactive websites.
- SQL for managing and querying databases
- C language for low-level programming and embedded systems
- How to use **GitHub** to share and organize my work

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Beginner-level projects using html,css,js, SQL, or C
- Learning communities or tutorials for students
- Fun coding exercises and challenges


⚡ Fun fact:
I once spent 2 hours fixing a bug... and it was a missing semicolon 😭

Thanks for stopping by! I’m still learning, but growing every day.
