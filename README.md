 👋 Hi, I’m @oumii-14

I'm a beginner programmer who's passionate about learning new technologies and building cool, useful things with code! 🚀
 👀 I’m interested in:
- Programming with **Visual Basic**, **C**, and **SQL**
- Building small apps, automation tools, and working with databases
- Learning how software works from the inside out

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Visual Basic (VB) for desktop applications
- SQL for managing and querying databases
- C language** for low-level programming and embedded systems
- How to use **GitHub** to share and organize my work

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Beginner-level projects using VB, SQL, or C
- Learning communities or tutorials for students
- Fun coding exercises and challenges


⚡ Fun fact:
I once spent 2 hours fixing a bug... and it was a missing semicolon 😭

Thanks for stopping by! I’m still learning, but growing every day.
